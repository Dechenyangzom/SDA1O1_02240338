## Overview
This repository contains a simple responsive webpage built using HTML and TailwindCSS. The webpage features a header, main content area with a button that includes a hover effect, and a footer with social media links. This README provides instructions on how to set up the project and includes guided practical exercises to help you understand the code and TailwindCSS.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom)

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

- *Clone the Repository*
Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the repository.

- *Navigate to the Project Directory*
Change into the project directory:
cd <project-directory>
Replace <project-directory> with the name of the cloned repository.

- *Open the HTML File*: Open the index.html file in your code editor. This file contains the HTML structure of the webpage.

- *Open the Webpage in Your Browser*:You can open the index.html file directly in your web browser to view the webpage. Simply double-click the file or right-click and select "Open with" followed by your preferred browser.

## Guided Practical Exercises
1. Modify the Header: 
    - Locate the header section in the index.html file.
    - Change the text inside the <h1> tag to something else, like "My Personal Website".

2. Customize the Button:
Find the button element in the main content section.
Change the button text from "Click ON :)" to "Get Started!".
Experiment with different TailwindCSS classes to change the button's background color, text color, and hover effect. For example, try changing bg-red-200 to bg-blue-500.
Save your changes and refresh the browser to see how the button looks.
Exercise 3: Add More Content
Below the existing paragraph in the main content section, add another paragraph with your own text.
Use TailwindCSS classes to style this new paragraph. For example, you can use class="text-base md:text-lg mb-6" for consistent styling.
Save and refresh to view your added content.
Exercise 4: Update Social Media Links
In the footer section, find the social media links.
Replace the href="#" with actual URLs of your social media profiles (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp).
Change the link text to your preferred social media names.
Save the file and refresh the browser to see the updates.
Exercise 5: Responsive Design Testing
Open your browser's developer tools (usually by right-clicking and selecting "Inspect" or pressing F12).
Use the device toolbar to simulate different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Observe how the layout adjusts according to the screen size. Make notes on any changes you see.
Try modifying the TailwindCSS classes to improve the responsiveness of the design.
Conclusion
By following the above exercises, you will gain hands-on experience with HTML and TailwindCSS while customizing a simple responsive webpage. Feel free to experiment further with the code and explore more TailwindCSS features to enhance your webpage.
