## Main Concepts Applied

-*Layout and Spacing*: I applied principles of layout design, working with Figma’s grid and rulers to ensure consistent spacing and alignment. This included accurately positioning text, images, and other elements.


## New Skills or Knowledge Gained

-*Layering and Grouping*: Organizing elements with layers and grouping helped me manage complex layouts efficiently, making it easier to adjust or rearrange elements as needed.


## Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them

-*Challenge*: Matching the spacing and alignment exactly as in the original website was challenging. Small differences in spacing were noticeable and affected the overall appearance.

*Solution*: I relied on Figma’s ruler and grid features to measure distances accurately. Using a grid overlay helped maintain consistent spacing, and double-checking alignment for each section improved precision.
