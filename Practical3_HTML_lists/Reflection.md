## Overview

The Course Management Webpage project aimed to create a simple HTML page that organizes and displays important academic information, including courses for the semester, a daily class schedule, a to-do list, and study goals. This project was designed to help students manage their time and tasks effectively.

## Learning Experience

  - Developed my time management skills by setting deadlines for different sections of the project.

### Key Takeaways

- I discovered the value of planning before implementation, which can save time and reduce errors during the coding process.

## Challenges Faced

### Challenge

- One of the main challenges I encountered was deciding how to best organize the information so that it was both informative and easy to navigate.
- I also faced difficulties in ensuring that the layout was visually appealing and that the content was not overwhelming.
