## Timetable ##

## Introduction
In this reflection, I will discuss my experience in creating a timetable using HTML. The project involved designing a simple yet effective table to display class schedules for a week.

## Learning Outcomes
1.Understanding HTML Structure:
   - I gained a deeper understanding of the HTML structure, including the use of tags like <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td>. This knowledge is essential for creating organized and accessible web content.

2.Table Design:
   - I learned how to create a table that is both functional and visually appealing. The use of headings for days of the week and time slots allows for easy navigation and comprehension of the schedule.

3.CSS Integration:
   - Although the CSS file (timetable.css) was linked, I realized the importance of styling in enhancing user experience. Future iterations will require me to focus on how to improve the visual aspects of the table.

## Challenges Faced
1. Content Organization: One challenge was effectively organizing the class data to avoid overlap and ensure clarity. I had to think critically about how to represent the schedule without causing confusion.

2. Responsive Design: Ensuring that the timetable is responsive and looks good on various devices is an area I need to explore further. I realized the importance of the viewport meta tag but need to implement CSS media queries for better responsiveness.

## Future Improvements
1. Enhanced Styling: I plan to work on the CSS file to improve the aesthetics of the timetable. This includes adding colors, borders, and hover effects to make the table more engaging.
2. Dynamic Features: In the future, I would like to incorporate JavaScript to make the timetable interactive, allowing users to filter classes by day or time.

## Conclusion
Creating the timetable was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my HTML skills and understanding of web design principles. I look forward to applying what Iâ€™ve learned in future projects and improving my technical skills further.
