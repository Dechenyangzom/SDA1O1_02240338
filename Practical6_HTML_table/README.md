## Guided Practical Exercises
1.Add More Classes:
   - Identify where the current classes are listed in the HTML.
   - Copy one of the existing <tr> elements and paste it below the last row.
   - Change the time and class names as desired.

2.Change Class Names:
   - Open the index.html file.
   - Locate the class names (e.g., CSF101, MAT205) in the table.
   - Replace them with new class names of your choice.
3.Add a CSS File:
   - Create a new file named timetable.css in the project directory.
   - Link this CSS file to your HTML document (if not already linked).
   - Add styles to improve the appearance of the table, such as changing the background color, font size, and borders.
4.Responsive Design:
   - Use media queries in your CSS file to adjust the table layout for smaller screens.
   - Test the timetable on various devices or browser sizes to see how it adjusts.
5.Add a Header:
   - Above the <h2>Timetable</h2> tag, add a new <h1> tag with a title for the timetable (e.g., "Weekly Class Schedule").
   - Style the header using CSS to make it visually appealing.
