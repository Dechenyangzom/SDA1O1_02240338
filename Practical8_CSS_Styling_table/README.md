## Project Overview
The timetable displays class schedules for each day of the week, organized by time slots. The current implementation includes classes for Monday through Friday, with time slots from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS 

## Guided Practical Exercises
1. Adding More Time Slots:
   - Open the index.html file in a text editor.
   - Add a new row for the time slot 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM under the existing rows in the table.
   - Fill in the class names for each day (you can use placeholders like NWC201).

2. Changing Class Names:
   - Choose a class from the existing timetable that you want to rename (e.g., CSF101).
   - Open the index.html file and locate the cell containing CSF101.
   - Change CSF101 to a new class name (e.g., CSF202).
   - Make sure to change it in both time slots where it appears.

3. Styling the Table:
   - Open the timetable.css file (create it if it doesn't exist).
   - Add styles to improve the appearance of the table.
