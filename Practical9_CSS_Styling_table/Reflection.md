# Reflection on HTML CSS styling table

## Main Concepts Applied

- *HTML Table Structure*: The document utilizes the <table> element to organize data in a structured format, making it easy to read and interpret. The use of <tr>, <th>, and <td> elements helps define the table rows, headers, and data cells, respectively.

- *Semantic HTML*: The use of headings (<h2>) enhances the document's structure, providing context to the table and improving accessibility for users.

- *Data Presentation*: The table format allows for clear comparison of different assignments, their maximum marks, marks obtained, percentages, and corresponding grades, facilitating easy analysis of performance.


## New Skills or Knowledge Gained

- *Table Design*: Gained experience in designing tables for displaying structured data, understanding how to effectively use table elements to convey information clearly.

- *Data Representation*: Improved knowledge of how to represent academic data in a way that is both informative and visually appealing.

- *Accessibility Considerations*: Learned the importance of using semantic elements and proper table structure to enhance accessibility for users with disabilities.


## Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them

- *Table Formatting*: Initially, there was uncertainty about how to format the table for optimal readability. This was resolved by experimenting with different layouts and ensuring that headers were appropriately defined for each column.

- *Data Accuracy*: Ensuring the accuracy of the data presented in the table required careful attention. This was managed by double-checking the values and ensuring that they were correctly aligned with the corresponding modules and assignments.

- *Styling Integration*: Without the accompanying CSS file, predicting how the table would visually appear was challenging. This was managed by planning to implement CSS styles in the future to enhance the visual presentation and usability of the table.
